2. New features

  * Support for the printNode() script function.
  * Support for the Window and Location interface subsets from
    SVG Tiny 1.2.

3. Improvements

  * DocumentType nodes are now created for XML documents where one was
    supplied in the markup (although only the name, publicId and systemId
    properties of the DocumentType object are filled in).
  * Dynamically created <script> elements inserted into the document are
    now executed (at most once, as with HTML).
  * The location bar in Squiggle is now updated if the requested document
    followed an HTTP redirect.
  * Improve Batik's Rhino class shutter so that it works with Rhino 1.6R7.
  * Allow SVGGenerator2D to embed fonts that weren't obtained from the
    standard AWT font lookup mechanism.
  * ttf2svg no longer outputs hkern elements outside user-provided glyph range.
  * Batik now tries to access content in HTTP error responses (for example, one
    is able to setup custom content for missing - HTTP code 404 - and/or other
    erroneous situations).
  * Internally registers not only font families but also makes font available
    through their font names.
  * All CSS font weights are now handled for font selection
  * Compatibility with GNU Classpath, OpenJDK and other open JVM was improved
    (image I/O is now used by default, over the Sun proprietary classes).

4. Bug fixes

  * Better DOM serialization code.
  * The prompt() script function now returns a proper ECMAScript String
    value instead of an object.
  * Changes to a CDATA section in a <style> element are now detected.
  * Fixed tight bounds calculation for Quadradic Bezier curves.
  * Now uses float for Document Dimensions.
  * Ensure motion animations that are removed from a document don't
    cause an NPE.
  * Animations that become frozen are now not incorrectly deprioritised
    compared to other animations on the same attribute.
  * Avoid canvas repaint problems that occur in some circumstances when
    it is being resized.
  * Exceptions are now thrown if an invalid QName is passed to
    DOMImplementation.createDocumentType().
  * DocumentType.getName() now returns the correct value.
  * Fixed SVGLocatable.farthestViewportElement to return null when
    called on the outermost <svg> element.
  * JavaScript fragments using different types within the one document
    (such as text/javascript and application/ecmascript) now share the
    same script interpreter.
  * Exporting 256 color indexed PNG files in Squiggle now works.
  * Avoid an NPE in ttf2svg when resolving substitutions for Arabic script.
  * ttf2svg now correctly writes out kerning pairs for characters that have
    no name.
  * SVGGraphics2D now serializes font-size values in style="" attributes
    with a unit.
  * Avoid an NPE when disposing a document that had animations targetting
    CSS properties on elements that subsequently became display:none.
  * The startOffset="" attribute on textPath elements now allows negative
    percentages.
  * Correctly handle individual missing <view> attributes by looking at
    the closest ancestor SVG element.
  * Fixed HeadlessExceptions related to WMF transcoding.
  * Font families containing numbers (like "Univers 45 Light") no longer
    cause errors.
  * Compiling on Oracle JDK 7 and JDK 8 now works.
  * On Windows, spaces within environment variables like JAVA_HOME no longer
    cause errors (JDK 6 and above default install location were moved from
    the system drive root to a Java folder inside Program Files).
  * Fixed a manifest issue affecting several Jars which prevented proper
    integration with NetBeans and other third-party IDEs and tools.
  * Several fixes for Rasterizer Task contribution (which was not building
    in Linux nor Cygwin and more).

1.5.1 -> 1.6
------------

1. Bugzilla problem reports fixed:

         28035, 28188, 28429, 28432, 28487, 29110, 29891, 30580, 30584,
         30739, 30923, 30925, 30948, 31603, 32108, 32435, 32872, 32951,
         33242, 33733, 33890, 33923, 33986, 34030, 34041, 34115

2. SVG 1.2 Features:

 * All SVG 1.2 elements/features have been moved from
   the Batik namespace into the SVG 1.2 namespace (except for
   flowText which remains, due to some loss of functionality
   with the current flowRoot and potential spec instability).
 * Implementation of SVG 1.2 flowRoot element (text flow into
   arbitrary regions with bidi support).
 * There is now an SVG12CSSEngine which has support for new
   properties in SVG 1.2

3. Improvements:

 * Massive performance improvement (>10X) for drawing on Mac OS X.
 * Document.getElementById now uses a Hashtable to speedup lookups.
 * JavaScript can now be used in an Applet out of the box.
 * Added support for 'font' shorthand property.
 * Added support for 'deselectAll' SVG DOM call.
 * getEncolsureList and getIntersectionList are implemented.
 * Added support for get[Screen]PixelUnitToMillimeterX/Y
 * SVG DOM getTotalLength, and getPointAtLength are now implemented.
 * Support for preserveAspectRatio DOM methods.
 * Squiggle browser now has a 'Save As' menu item.
   * Can toggle if xml:base should be added to saved SVG.
   * Can 'pretty print' saved XML for readability.
 * ExtensibleSVGDOMImplementation no longer exists,
   the SVGDOMImplementation is now extensible.  There is a
   new baseclass ExtensibleDOMImplementation that provides
   extension capabilities to any DOMImplementation subclass.
   As a result the name of the services meta-file has moved to:
    'org.apache.batik.dom.DomExtension'
   from:
    'org.apache.batik.dom.svg.DomExtension'.
   People with DOM extension will have to update the service file
   accordingly.
 * ExtensibleDOMImplementation now allows 'extension' elements in
   the SVG Namespace (they are always lower priority than 'buit ins').
 * When a new Document is loaded a new BridgeContext is created for it.
   As a result each document now get's it's own CSS engine.
 * ttf2svg now supports 'auto ranging' so it looks at the font
   to decide what to output.
 * DOM will now detect when the child passed to insert/remove
 * AbstractParentNode will now throw a DOM Hierarchy exception
   if you try to append a node as a child of it's self (PR 34030)
 * Anti-aliased clips (hqClip patch).  This can be disabled by setting
   the transcoding hint to vector or print (so content doesn't get
   rasterized). PR 29110.
 * Control of tiled image rendering based on rendering hint.
   Using this hint may greatly increase the amount of memory used.
 * The Marker interface now has a 'getCharIndex()' method to
   get the index of the character the Mark is associated with.
   node is not the child of the node insert/remove is called on.
 * DrawImage now defaults color model to sRGB_Unpre if the destination
   doesn't include alpha.
 * The pattern element now shares one rendering tree across all
   references.
 * Some improvements for Kerning in SVG Font (faster)
 * Arabic diacritics are now positioned relative to the right edge
   of the base glyph. Bug 28429
 * Basic DocumentType implementation, if present DOMUtilities will
   now emit a proper doctype specification
 * GVT Tree walker can now be given any node in the GVT tree and it
   walk just that subtree.
 * Many places now use getResource as Stream instead of Resource
   bundles where localization is not wanted/needed.
 * Tweaked UpdateManager repaint scheduling alg.
   It now tracks when the rendering goes 'out of date'
   with the document and runs runnables until it is out of
   them or MIN_REPAINT_TIME is exceeded.
 * Arc2D now translated to path with elliptical arc commands
   in SVGGraphics2D interface.
 * JSVGScrollPane now uses bbox of geometry if no viewBox is provided.
 * Refactored the text and flow bridges so make things cleaner.
 * Implemented textLength to return the value of
   getComputedTextLength when the textLength attribute is not
   set.
 * Potentially large optimization in BBox generation
 * The DOM tree viewer now has an option to hide text nodes that
   only contain whitespace.
 * The DOM tree viewer now includes the id of an element in the
   tree view if it has one.
 * Improvements to empty bounds handling, should decrease update areas.

   live resize of large documents.
 * Some refactoring/restructuring of svggen.XmlWriter to potentially
   make it a pretty printing DOM serializer.
 * Latest pdf-transcoder from FOP which supports '-dpi' switch.
 * ScrollPane now should do a better job of fitting document w/o
   scrollbars
 * title and desc changes are now dynamically tracked.
 * ScriptFactorys now loaded via Services interface.
 * Made the JDK image loading Mediatracker static
   (so others could use it easier).
 * ParsedURL now uses the current Batik version as it's default
   UserAgent
 * Rationalized Text Selection code.  Copy to clipboard is now done
   by JGVTComponent only if 'unix style' text selection is requested
   (default).

 * Fixed all known memory leaks with loading images.
 * Changing documents in JSVGScrollPane now works properly.
 * Fixed a small memory leak when changing xlink:href on a

 * Fixed potential interrupted bug in the RunnableQueue class.
 * The document loader cache now uses soft references to avoid
   being a memory leak.
 * Improved the xml:space support.
 * textPath no longer supports 'position attributes' on it's self
 * textPath now supports progression position attributes provided

   previously in some cases it was an inner class.
 * Fix for masks when using Alpha Premultiplied (Mac OS X).
 * Improved consistency of events from the RunnableQueue.
   Calling suspend/resumeExecution should now always generate
   a runHandler event (although the events may be "compressed"
   so suspend/resume may only generate one resume event).
 * Fixed bug in handling kerning elements with multiple glyph entries
   in g/u 1or2.
 * Removed use of 'getTagName' to use 'getLocalName' to avoid issues with
   prefixed svg elements.
 * Fixed a mistake in the generation of SVG fonts that include
   arabic forms (PR 33733)

  Thanks to everyone on batik-dev/users for reporting problems and
  working on finding solutions.


1.5 -> 1.5.1
------------
1. Security:

   A script security issue was reported in the Batik Squiggle
   browser. Squiggle uses the Rhino scripting engine and some features
   of that engine can be leveraged by malicious scripts to gain access
   to otherwise protected resources (like the file system).

   The Batik team has worked with the Rhino team to fix the isssue
   that was reported and the Batik 1.5.1 patch release addresses the
   issue.

2. Features:

   Rhino JavaScript Debugger now integrated with Squiggle.
   Better line numbers in error messages.
   Zachary DelProposto's Scroll pane class is added.  Allows for
      scrollbars on SVG documents.
   Cool solitaire examples in SVG.

3. Performance fixes:

   Parents who have children added/removed no longer invalidate
      their entire area.
   When a element is removed or CSS properties changed all next
      siblings are not repainted unless CSS rules change them.
   First event dispatch is much quicker than the past.
   Switched to Xerces 2.5.0 to improve performance of data protocol.
   Changes to paint properties on text is now _much_ faster.
   When using many objects from an external file the file will only
     be loaded/parsed once.
   Modifying x/y and some viewBox changes on SVG elements is now much
     faster.
   Better JPEG embedding in PDF.

4. Conformance:
   Batik now passes all non SMIL-Animation tests from the SVG Working
     Group beSuite.

   @font-face CSS property and font-face elements are now compliant
     with SVG specification.

   Changes to the 'class' attribute now update rendering tree
     correctly.

   selectSubString now implemented.

   Dynamic modification of display, and marker properties supported.
   SVG 'a' element respects 'preventDefault' on event object.
   Pattern element no longer applies object bounding box transform
      if viewBox is specified.

5. Bugs:

   Fullscreen mode (F11) works again.
   getExtentOfChar() returns bbox in text elements coordinate system.
   SVGPoint now supports matrixTransform in more cases
   clientX/Y now correct when target is a text element.
   Bugfix in parsing some TrueType fonts fixed.
   Now applies the 'all' media type to all content.
   Image transcoders default to 400x400 rather than issuing an error
     (consistent with viewer).
   The properties opacity/filter/masking/pointer-events now work
      on SVG elements.
   Clearing text selection now works
   Zero width/height image elements now work properly.
   BBox info is correct for zero width/height items.
   Fills/strokes text when text-rendering is set to geometricPrecision
      rather than using drawGlyphVector.
   getCssText() returns the relative version of URI's
   SVG Graphics2D outputs correct rendering hints for text.
   TextNodes returns the correct bounds.
   Proper text child set as 'target' of events.
   Events handled correctly for documents that reference the same
      image multiple times.
   Image are displayed as 'broken links' instead of being an error.
   FeColorMatrix now respects color-interpolation-filters property.
   elem.style.setProperty now works for shorthand properties.
   Fixed race condition in JSVGComponent.set[SVG]Document.
   Fixed several memory leaks dealing with use element.
   Glyph element's 'd' attribute uses inherited winding-rule.
   SVG 'style' element no longer generates multiple 'xml:space' attrs.
   SAXDocumentFactory now generates only one CData node for each
     CData section in source document.
   Memory leak with addEventListener and objects that ref event target fixed.
   Click events now allow a small amount of 'slop'.
   Fixed bug in rendering with Double Buffering.
   Clicking on the Canvas no longer clears the system clipboard.
   No longer recascades elements in use tree from foreign documents
   Now supports CSS properties with the max negative 32bit int value
   Now supports more JPEG image types.
   No longer throws a Class Cast exception when using named colors
     as the fallback for icc-colors

1.5beta5 -> 1.5
---------------

1. Features:

       - With JDK 1.4 text-rendering="optimizeSpeed" will render
         non-anti-aliased hinted text (for axially aligned text).

       - The pointer-events property is now handled correctly for elements
         without fill or stroke paint.

       - Improved stroke accuracy when shape-rendering="geometricPrecision"

       - JSVGComponent.setSVGDocument with 'null' now releases all
         heavy resources and makes the Canvas display only Background.

       - Many memory leaks fixed.

       - Transcoders and JSVGComponent will now accept any Document
         and convert to a Batik SVG Document if needed.

       - Script interpreters are loaded lazily.  This means that unless you
         use them (by having event attributes or script elements) you
         don't need any script engines.

   Performance Improvements:

       - Image drawing is now 5-10x faster, for most raster images.

       - Significant performance improvement for patterns that are
         filtered or have filters applied to them (take Batik70 for
         example).

       - AbstractParentNode insertNode, removeNode, replaceNode are
         now much faster for Parents with many children.


   Library changes:

       - Updated to the Rhino 1.5R41 library

   Others:

       - Added control of floating point precision used in SVGGraphics2D
         (see the org.apache.batik.svggen.SVGGeneratorContext class)

       - Batik now almost never opens image URL's twice.

       - JSVGComponent/BridgeContext now has three levels of interactivity.
         STATIC, INTERACTIVE, DYNAMIC.  With increasing memory overhead
         and build time requirements.

       - Improved test environment with automated memory leak, performance,
         threading and interactivity tests. There are now over 1000 tests
         in the regard regression test suite.

       - Window.parseXML now returns a Document when no 'host'
         Document provided.

4. Documentation:

       - Updated the FAQ with frequent questions on UpdateManager, DOM
         updates and visual updates.

       - Updated the implementation status page and the home page.


1.5beta4b -> 1.5beta5
---------------------

1. Features:

   Library changes:

       - Xerces 2.3 is now the default parser. The parser can still be controlled
         through the org.apache.batik.util.XMLResourceDescriptor class.

         ** NOTE **

         While the general performance of the Xerces 2.3 parser seems equivalent
         to those of the Crimson parser used previously, there is a notable exception
         in the handling of long attributes. This makes a very visible difference
         for SVG content that uses embeded images through the 'data:' protocol which
         can be extremely slow with Xerces 2.3. The bookOfKells.svgz example, which
         used the data: protocol for rather long images has been removed from the
         distribution as it does not load in a reasonable amount of time when using
         Xerces.

       - Rhino version has been updated from 1.5R3 to 1.5R4 allowing to fix
         BR #11968 (DOM access functions should return ECMAScript strings).

       - Removed SAX and DOM sources from the Batik project. Now use xml-apis.jar
         from xml-commons.

   Others:

       - currentScale/Translate now implemented (get and set).

       - Implemented getScreenCTM, fixed getCTM (SVGLocatable)

       - onzoom, onscroll, onresize events are now implemented.

       - Integrated pdf-transcoder from FOP.

       - Ctrl-K/L work in fullscreen mode.

       - initial support for SVGList ( provided for SVGPointList in
         <polygon> and <polyline>, SVGPathSegList in <path>, SVGLengthList
         in textual elements, SVGTransformList in graphical elements )

       - RFE #12735 : added support for dynamic modifications of 'xlink:href' in image element

       - Now skips reading the SVG DTD unless validation
         is turned on (improves load times for small docs).

       - glyph-orientation-horizontal now works.

       - linearGradient's can now be anti-aliased (radial gradient
         anti-aliasing also improved).

       - PNG Transcoder can now produce 1,2,4 & 8 bit indexed PNG's.

       - rasterizer can now be used in headless mode (JDK 1.4)

       - JPEG files now have X/YDensity set according to -dpi option.

       - Batik Docs now include a dependency graph for the jar files.

       - In ECMAScript, add the ability to pass an Object instead of a
         Function to the Window.getURL() method in which case the
         operationComplete method is called once the URL is retrieved.

       - SVGUserAgent now controls the default font-family

       - Added max-width and max-height support in the rasterizer infrastructure
         (contribution by Henri Ruini, Henri.Ruini@nokia.com)

       - Improvements to the WMFTranscoder by Luan O'Caroll

       - Added better error reporting for external scripts: errors now include the uri
         of the external scripts in addition to the line number which is convenient
         when an SVG file references multiple external scripts.

       - Modified the way SVG public identifiers are mapped to system identifiers.
         The resource file now contains the mapping to the correct SVG DTD instead
         of only containing the allowed SVG 1.0 system identifiers for a hard
         coded DTD.

       - Added support for cursors.

Bug Fixes:

       - clientX/Y values in MouseEvents are now returned in screen
         pixels (it had been the viewBox coordinate system which was
         convenient but wrong and problematic for some cases).

       - Changed default extension for TIFF files to '.tif' from '.tiff'.

       - Fixed bugs in screen updating when the size/location of the
         root graphics node changed, and when transform on group
         changes after bounds on a child.

       - ToolTips no longer 'hang around' under JDK 1.4.1

       - The JSVGCanvas no longer steals focus and pops forward whenever
         the cursor passes over the canvas.

       - The JSVGCanvas will no longer thrown an exception if an SVG
         document is set prior to the component's size being set.

       - Text anchor for vertical text.

       - For corrupt/incomplete JPEG images now shows what it can.

       - Fixed bug with Indexed PNG's that have a bKGD chunk.

       - getRelatedTarget fixed for mouseout event.

       - glyph-orientation-horizontal/vertical no longer require a unit
         as per the SVG specification.

       - Fixes for 'jar' protocol.

       - Fixed compressed Tiff writing.

       - Missing Glyph's are now rendered correctly.

       - Text selection now works better with altGlyphs.

       - PrintTranscoder no longer scales 'real world' units wrong.

       - Fixed a bug involving the 'use' element with a width/height in
         an SVGFont referenced from external documents.

       - Collaboration with Philipe Converset (Qarbon) on an extension to define
         margins in filter regions. This is now supported in the Batik namespace.

2. Bugs:

        12389  Focus issue in Squiggle's URL text field
        12121  Cursor in URL field disappears
        12168  MarkerShapePainter delivers wrong PaintedArea

        17183  baseline-shift doesn't refer to parent "line-height"
        15063  Version-dependent code in package org.apache.batik.gvt.font
        12736  Allow non-element nodes to be added to g and svg elements.

       - Added Units resolutions to CSS rects

       - 'd' and 'points' can now be empty on <path>, <polygon> and
         <polylines>

       - Now support the transform attribute on the <switch> element

       - Fixed class loader delegation bug in RhinoClassLoader

       - Patch from Keiron Liddle fixing PNGTranscoder KEY_INDEXED hint type
         issue (was Boolean instead of Integer)

3. Extensions:

       - Binary distributions now include jar files that can display
         extensions.

       - The multImage element can now reference SVG images as well
          as raster images.

       - flowText now supports vertical-align.

       - flowText now uses 'flowRegion' and 'rect' to describe flow
         areas.

4. Documentation:

       - Status of Batik implementation of SVG DOM.

       - Diagram showing the various Batik jar files and their relationships.


1.5beta4 -> 1.5beta4b
---------------------

This is a patch release fixing a bug on linking.


1.5beta3 -> 1.5beta4
--------------------

1. Features

  - Squiggle Browser:

       - the F11 key lets users enter the full screen mode or exit the
         full screen mode if they are already in that mode.

       - the Browser can now handle XML files which contain a stylesheet
         declaration referencing an XSL transformation. If that transformation
         generates an SVG document, Squiggle will display it.

         By default, this feature is disabled because it requires that
         the user either uses the JDK 1.4 (or greater) version (which at
         this time is not a requirement for Batik) or that an XSL transformation
         engine (such as Xalan) be in the classpath.

         To enable the feature, uncomment the following line (i.e., remove the '#'):

         in the:

         resources/META-INF/services/org.apache.batik.apps.svgbrowser.SquiggleInputHandler

         file.

  - Scripting:

       - Added the ability to use an ECMAScript object providing an handleEvent
         method for the listener argument of the addEventListener method on DOM objects
         (previously only ECMAScript functions were accepted as parameter). [RFE9149]

2. Bug Fixes

  - Images - bounds/hints now updated correctly when changed via script
  - Local refs now work with null Document URL.

  - ParseXML no longer assumes doc is SVG.
  - Squiggle can now do Http authentication.
  - SVG Font bounds fix
  - Text layout fix (anchor and textLength)
  - Adding/Removing children no longer invalidates entire parent region.
  - handling of position attributes (x,y,dx,dy,rotate) on emtpy tspans has been fixed.
  - Fixed improper handling on <altGlyphItem>
  - Removed unnecessary font matching with <altGlyph> which can be found
  - 'stroke-dasharray' now works with units,
  - fixed bugs (CSS !important rules, DOM replaceChild on the root element,
    SVG paint parsing, CSS percentages).


1.5beta2 -> 1.5beta3
--------------------

1. Features:

  - Squiggle Browser:

       - now keeps a history of recently visited URIs

       - offers more control over the security features

  - Enhanced Security Support:

       - downloading of all external resources can now be
         controlled through the UserAgent. This includes
         scripting (as before) but also <image>, <use>, and
         all elements which may reference external resources
         (over 15).

       - users security policy now takes precedence over the
         application policy. Users can set the java.security.policy
         system property when starting a Batik application and it
         will take precedence.

  - Interactivity and Scripting Support Improvements:

       - filter, mask, gradients, clip, pattern and marker are now
         updated when the geometry of the referencing graphical
         element is dynamically changed.

       - implementation of keyboard events (KeyEvents from DOM Level 2
         Working Draft). In the near future, the batik team will
         implement the TextEvents from the DOM Level 3 Events module.

       - Newly supported elements (can now be modified by scripts):
         <svg>, <image> and <text> element children (such as <tspan>);

      - Support for addition/removal/modification of stylesheets

  - Misc:

       - external scripts can now be gzipped.

       - added getPixelUnitToMillimeter to UserAgent classes
         NOTE: the getPixelToMM and getPixelToMillimeter methods will be
               removed after 1.5b3 is released!

       - Improvements in the support for the <flowText> extension

      - Added support for attribute/id/adjacent selector and :first-child
        dynamic updates,

    #9058, #9067, #9304, #9429, #9520, #9779, #9804, #9272, #9276,
  - bug in feColorMatrix
  - DOM: getElementByTagName, invalidateElementsByTagName, cloneNode(false)
  - mouseout bug on <tspan> fixed
  - File->Open dialog bug on JDK 1.4 fixed.
  - Memory leak fixes

  - MultiImage now respects xml:base
  - Fixed mouse location bug

3. Documentation Update:

  - Many additional links have been added to the Batik documentation
    as well as improvements in its structure and content, thanks to
    the work of Robert Di Blasi.


1.5beta1 -> 1.5beta2
--------------------

** Note on the new security support **

- Scripts are now run in a sand-box by default for the Batik sample
  applications (the Squiggle SVG Browser and the Rasterizer). Users of
  the SVG toolkit who what to run scripts securely need to add
  security support in their application and may use the work done for
  Squiggle as an example
  (e.g., see the org.apache.batik.util.ApplicationSecurityEnforcer class).

- There is a known limitiation: scripts loaded from a 'file:' url
  cannot access (i.e., load files) under the same root. This is not
  true for scripts loaded from a server (e.g., 'http:' urls).

1. Features:

  - Scripting support for styling properties:

      - Most of the CSS properties and style attributes can now
        be changed dynad:/work/dev/svg/apache/builds/batik-1.5beta3/mically. See:
        http://xml.apache.org/batik/supportedProperties.html

      - Added support for style and class attributes dynamic updates

  - DOM support:

      - Implementation of SVGLocatable including SVGMatrix

      - All class members of type: SVGLength now works on most of the
        graphical elements (rect.x.baseVal.value)

      - Implementation of CSS DOM (getStyle, getComputedStyle...)

  - Events/Interactivity:
     - DOMFocusIn, DOMFocusOut and DOMActivate event types are not supported

  - Security:

     - Secure scripting is now in place. Scripts in ECMAScript or
       Java code are run in a sand-box by default. The Batik browser
       (called Squiggle), has the following security options:
        . secure execution of scripts can be on or off.
        . scripts for a given language can be disabled/enabled.
        . scripts can be constrained to come from the same origin
          as the document referencing them.
       In the Squiggle SVG browser, the security options can be set
       through the Preferences dialog, in the browser options panel.

  - Misc:

     - xml:base is now supported for the image element.

     - <flowText> extension element that flows text into multiple boxes.
       Trying to track the SVG 1.1 Working Group on this element.

     - getURL, parseXML supported in the Window object.

  - Testing:

     - Improved test infrastructure. There are new tests for handling
       automatic regression testing of scripting features and there are
       more tests (801 now) in the regard regression test suite.

2. Bug Fixing:

  - Fixed bugs with textPath w/ text-anchor, and textPath w/ multiple
    trailing tspan elements.

  - Work around for RenderingHints when Batik Jars loaded multiple times
    in the same JVM (through different class loaders).

  - Fixed a bug with X/Y Resolution for Tiff.

  - UIEvents are not dispatched properly on <text> children (<tspan>...)

  - <a> is now supported on <text> element children


1.1.1 -> 1.5beta1
-----------------

** Note on enhanced scripting support **

- Support for DOM Core and DOM Events (Mutation events and UI events)

- Limitations:
   - No support for dynamic modification of CSS properties.
     In particular, setAttributeNS of presentation attributes
     such as 'fill' or 'stroke' or modification of the 'style'
     attribute are not supported.

1. Features:
  - Enhanced scripting support: it is now possible to modify
    SVG documents through scripting
  - Tiff Transcoder now takes FORCE_TRANSPARENT_WHITE hint.
  - Tiff Transcoder now writes resolution tags.
  - Implementation of SVG 1.1 solidColor element (in Batik extensions)

    images/filters).
  - Applying a ICC Profile no longer messes up alpha channel in some cases.
  - PNG Transcoder now always writes sRGB chunk.
  - feImage image positioning fix
  - <use> bridge fix,

    - AbstractRable constructors problem fixed.
    - Put in workaround for worst of Mac OS X text problems (layout
      still isn't 100% correct in most cases).
    - Removed code that is no longer needed in GlyphLayout
    - Fixed the last text layout issues on Mac OS X (GlyphVector was
      returning the metrics for the first char for all chars in the vector.
      We now use the difference in defaultGlyphPositions to get the
      character advances).
    - Fixed JViewerFrame issue with large (width/height) documents.

2. Improvements
    - Text bounds computation is now much faster

      SVG Font format. This contribution was made by David Schweinsberg
      of SteadyState (david@steadystate.co.uk). This contribution comes at
      the right time (i.e., as we just added SVG Font rendering suppor).

2. Improvements & new features

   a. SVG Font support. Initial revision of the soon complete support of
      SVG Fonts.

   b. New image encoder/decoder infrastructure. This allows a flexible
      handling of new raster image formats.

   c. Improved PNG encoder/decoder which now support the gamma chunk
      properly.

   d. Additional tests for SVGGraphics2D.

   e. Additional samples (mostly new SVG Font support examples).


beta2rc8 -> beta2rc9
--------------------

a. Polishing of existing features.
b. Bug fixes.
c. Improved test infrastructure.


beta2rc7 -> beta2rc8
--------------------

1. Improvements

   a. Full blown in-bound and out-bound linking support. See the
      two new linking examples in the samples/test directory.

   b. Improved CSS error handling.

   c. New test infrastructure.

   d. Beanified SVG JComponent: see JSVGCanvas.

   e. Enhanced features in SVGGraphics2D to manage style properties.

   e. Improved error handling in SVGGraphics2D

2. General

   a. Added line-number in error messages when parsing invalid
      SVG document.
   b. Maintenance and Bug fixing.
   c. JSVGCanvas is now a JavaBean which can be easily configured
      in IDE tools to add SVG viewing support in an application.
   d. Support for rendering hints such as text-rendering and
      shape-rendering.


beta2rc5 -> beta2rc6
--------------------

1 - new implementation of the swing component and viewer.

  a. it is now possible to interrupt while loading, building or painting
  b. rotations are now applied on the image in real time. document is
     repainted when the mouse button is released.
  c. real time zoom on the image with SHIFT+BUTTON 2 Drag
  d. progressive rendering has been improved
  e. toggling debug traces on/off to see performance is now possible

2 - new implementation of the bridge package

  a. code cleanup
  b. percentages are now handled correctly (both for xml attributes and CSS
     properties - samples/tests/percentagesAndUnits.svg)
  c. error handling has been improved
     (line number will be available soon)
  d. the building phase is now 30% faster
  e. bug fix with <pattern> (samples/tests/pattern*.svg)
  f. <marker> is now conformed to the current SVG spec (as of March 15)
  g. percentages are now handled correctly on the outermost SVG element (need
     to do the same for the ImageTranscoder)


3 - Transcoders. There are two new transcoders:

  a. WMF -> SVG Transcoder. This is a contribution to the Batik project from
     Luan O'Caroll (Luan.O'Carroll@boimail.com). You can run the transcoder on
     a set of Windows MetaFile (WMF) using the
     org.apache.batik.transcoder.wmf.tosvg.WMFTranscoder application.

  b. Printing Transcoder. This implementation of the Transcoder interface will
     print a set of SVG document to the default printer (see
     org.apache.batik.transcoder.print.PrintTranscoder).

4 - Misc.

  a. support for System colors (see: samples/tests/systemColors.svg)

  b. Creating custom Graphics2D implementation is now easier. A generic part of
     the SVGGraphics2D has been moved into a new package:
     org.apache.batik.ext.awt.g2d.
     This new package facilitates the creation of transcoders that will convert
     SVG documents to an arbitrary format by providing a Graphics2D implementation
     for that format that Batik can use to draw an SVG document (Batik can use
     a Graphics2D to paint an SVG document).

NOTE: Known regressions.

  a. next, previous and thumbnail have been momentarily removed from the viewer.
  b. error messages are printed in the console and not in a dialog.
  c. the partial internal linking support has been removed until
     a full implementation of linking can be done.
  d. printing has not been reintegrated into the new viewer.
  e. regressions may appear for scripting as it has been added in a hurry for
     this release. A clean pass will be done soon.
  f. text regression on tspan handling where dx/dy are temporarily not working.

b. Some support for markers (not complete yet, but should be complete
   shortly, probably by next week).
c. Some support for views (in linking).
